# Rails 5 API Demo
## Work in Progress
----
### Overview
I am building a Demo API with rails 5 and adding features as I go.Planning to couple it with an Angular 2 SPA later.

## Features
* Custom adapters for Hypermedia types,currently only [Siren](https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren).(Plus JSON-API which comes bundled with Active Model Serializers
* DRY Base Controller.
* Authentication.I spent several days to explore options for this.I'll probably go with [Devise Token Auth](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/devise_token_auth). Or maybe a more simple solution with [JWT](https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt).
* Authorization. Pundit.(Coming soon)
