      summary: Obtain JSON Web Token (JWT)
      description: If you get a 401 Unauthorized server response you are either
                   unauthenticated or not authorized.In former case you have
                   to provide an authentication token (JWT) in the header for every request.Swagger UI will
                   take care of this if you fill the api_key field (upper right of the window) with the JWT
                   and press explore.
                   You get a new JWT by executing this operation with valid user credentials.
